		<p> A land-grant institution with more than 35,000 students across a five-campus system, we've graduated more than 240,000 students to serve the state of Oklahoma, <br>
		the nation and the world. Students from across the U.S. and more than 100 countries converge on this campus creating a vibrant and inclusive culture. With a student <br>
		-to-faculty ratio of 20:1, we will help you prepare for the future by providing the academic support you need. Founded on Dec. 25, 1890 as Oklahoma Agricultural <br>
		and Mechanical College, OSU's land-grant mission is to make a college education more accessible. Our roots are set in a rich tradition, and our actions are guided<br>
		by the Cowboy Code. Since taking office in 2008, President Burns Hargis and First Cowgirl Ann Hargis have created a campus culture of collaboration, innovation, <br>
		wellness and success. Their leadership combined with that of our faculty and staff shapes the various divisions and departments of OSU. Located in northeast <br>
		Oklahoma, Stillwater is just 60 miles from both Oklahoma City and Tulsa. Southern Living ranked Stillwater sixth on its list for "The South's Friendliest <br>
		Cities 2018," and OSU sits at the heart of it all.
