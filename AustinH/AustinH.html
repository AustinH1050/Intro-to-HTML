<p><h3>I Like to take apart computers and put them back together.
<p>
I like to rebuild or fix broken computers.
<p>
I like to work on cars
<p>
I like learning new things on a computer.
<p>
I like programing, just not Java!

<p>
I am passionate about working on computers. Ever since I was really young I remember taking apart computers and not being able to take them apart. <br> Then in middleschool I started taking programming classes and got more in depth with computers. <br> Now in highschool I have taken more programming classes and I am apart of the cyber corp where I can help (teachers) with a problem if they have one.</p>
